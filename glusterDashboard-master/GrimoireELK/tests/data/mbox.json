            "plain": "Hey Jesus,\n\nthanks ;)\nI wonder: What is the difference between your \"revisor\" project and the\nGerrit backend of Bicho?\n\"Only\" the approach?\nOr is \"revisor\" one of those tools you mentioned (retrieving, dumping,\nextracting)?\n\nRegarding the query limit you are right.\nThe default query limit per SSH is 500 Changesets per query.\nThis number was hardcoded a long time in Gerrit and is now configurable.\nBut most systems does not change this.\nA query limit per HTTP can be defined per user account. But for most\nsystems a \"few\" HTTP requests are fine.\nNormally the Gerrit instances are not like a real SaaS (like Github) with\nlimited API requests. They do not care about some HTTP / SSH requests.\n\nYou are right. The HTTP API is more easy.\nBut i agree. Currently some information (still) missing on the HTTP\ninterface instead of the SSH interface.\nI focussed on the SSH API for the same reason.\nBut i am active on the Gerrit mailing list, too and asked them which will\nbe the main API in future. They said that the HTTP is the main one and SSH\nwill be obsolete more and more.\n\nThe documentation was a really hard part of this tool.\nI never expected to write documentation is such a big amount of work.\nBut the main reason to write this is to make contributions possible.\nOtherwise no one is able to use this tool.\nThe documentation is based on restructured text and ReadTheDocs.org.\nHere you can find some details:\nhttp://gerrie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing/documentation.html\n\nI would love to see such a documentation for MetriceGrimoire tools as well.\nReadTheDocs has the origin in the python community as well.\nMaybe we can start this? What do you think?\n\nI plan to extend Gerrie more and more and to support HTTP as well.\nIncremental updates are possible right now.\nBut i have to see when this will be possible.\nIf you want to use this or got questions how i solved a detailed problem,\njust let me know.\n\nHave a nice day,\nAndy\n\n2014-12-01 10:14 GMT+01:00 Jesus M.
